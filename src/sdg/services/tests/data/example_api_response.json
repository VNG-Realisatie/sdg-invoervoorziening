      "titel": "Certificate of conduct for individuals (VOG NP)",
      "tekst": "In the Netherlands, a [Certificate of conduct](https://www.justis.nl/en/products/certificate-of-conduct) (Verklaring omtrent het gedrag, VOG) indicates that the recipient has not committed any criminal offences. For some jobs, like teaching, childminding or driving a taxi, a VOG is compulsory. In other cases, employers are free to decide whether they want to ask their employee for a VOG, which is sometimes referred to as a Declaration of (good) conduct. There is also a [VOG for legal entities](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/vogrp/).\r\n\r\n## Who needs a VOG?\r\n\r\nA certificate of conduct for individuals (VOG NP) is legally required for some professions, for instance:\r\n\r\n*   everyone who works in education (primary and secondary education, secondary vocational education and special-needs education)\r\n*   [everyone who works in childcare](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/register-for-persons-active-in-the-childcare-sector/)\r\n*   [taxi drivers](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/permit-operate-taxi-service/)\r\n*   driving instructors and driving school owners\r\n\r\nIt is also mandatory for employees and volunteers who work:\r\n\r\n*   with confidential information (such as doctors or lawyers)\r\n*   with vulnerable people (for instance in healthcare)\r\n*   with money or valuable goods (such as accountants or mortgage advisors)\r\n*   for the government\r\n\r\nIn all other instances the collective labour agreement (cao) in your company or sector, determines if you ask an employee or volunteer for a VOG.\r\n\r\n## VOG application procedure\r\n\r\nEmployees and self-employed professionals (zzp'ers) who are registered in the Municipal Personal Records Database (BRP) can obtain a VOG from their local municipality. Companies can also [apply for a VOG online](https://mijn.justis.nl/vog/vogorganisatie/inloggen.htm) (in Dutch) using [eHerkenning](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/applying-for-a-permit-or-subsidy-with-eherkenning/) level 2 or higher. Companies prepare the application for their employee, who then receives an email and completes the application with their DigiD. Freelancers/self-employed professionals may authorise their client to apply for a VOG on their behalf.\r\n\r\nIf the applicant is not registered in the Municipal Personal Records Database, they can [submit the application form to the Central Agency for Certificates of Good Conduct (COVOG)](https://www.justis.nl/en/products/certificate-of-conduct#applying-for-a-certificate-of-conduct) of the judiciary service Justis (Ministry of Justice and Security).\r\n\r\n## Checking a VOG\r\n\r\nYou can only [check if a VOG is genuine](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/publicaties/2020/11/30/voorbeeld-vog-np-per-1-december-2020-tcm34-471545) (in Dutch) if you have the original paper version. You can check the document for the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n*   the paper has a grid and features the blue government logo\r\n*   the paper features a watermark\r\n*   in UV light the paper remains dark and the graphic mark on the lower right is luminous\r\n*   in UV light, on a VOG NP you can see a luminous rectangle surrounding the blue N-number\r\n*   you can see a hologram in the paper\r\n\r\n## VOG denial\r\n\r\nA request for a VOG may be denied if the applicant has received a relevant criminal conviction in a specific timeframe prior to the application. This denial could either be based on police data about the applicant or based on data registered in the Dutch Judicial Documentation System (JDS). You can [contact Justis](https://www.justis.nl/en/service-contact/how-to-contact-justis) to express your view or object to the decision.\r\n\r\n## VOG for childcare workers\r\n\r\nOwners, employees and office personnel working in the childcare sector must have a VOG. Persons of 18 years of age or older who share accommodation with a registered childminder, must also apply for a VOG. Trainees, temporary employees, volunteers and parents working in your establishment must request a new VOG every 2 years. If a trainee or temporary employee changes trainee posts or working locations, the existing VOG will suffice. This does not apply to volunteers; they must request a new one.\r\n\r\nThere are two screening profiles available for persons active in the childcare sector: Screening profile 84 (caring for minors) or 86 (working in the childcare sector).\r\n\r\n### Application forms VOG childcare\r\n\r\nThere are different application forms for VOGs for childcare:\r\n\r\n*   [Application form for VOG for individual owner of childcare centre](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/formulieren/2013/02/26/aanvraagformulier-vog-voor-houders-organisatie.html) (in Dutch)\r\n*   [Application form for VOG for individual childcare workers and those living on the childcare premises](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/kinderopvang/documenten/formulieren/2015/12/18/vog-np-niet-houders) (in Dutch)\r\n*   [Application form for VOG for individuals who are structurally present during direct or indirect care for children](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/kinderopvang/documenten/formulieren/2018/02/27/aanvraagformulier-structureel-aanwezige-indirecte-zorg-kinderen) (in Dutch)\r\n\r\nA copy of the VOG must be retained in your (personnel) files and the member of staff must register in the [register for persons active in the childcare sector](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/register-for-persons-active-in-the-childcare-sector/). These certificates and registration records must be presented during GGD inspections.\r\n\r\n### Continuous screening\r\n\r\nChildcare workers are screened for criminal offences on a continuous basis. The supervisory body will notify you in the event of a criminal offence. Your employee will then have to apply for a new VOG. Failure to obtain this new certificate is grounds for dismissal. Continuous screening also applies to trainees, temporary personnel, volunteers and parents working in your establishment.\r\n\r\n## Online application procedure via Message Box\r\n\r\nIf you require a VOG for a [procedure that is subject to the Services Act](https://business.gov.nl/starting-your-business/communicating-with-the-dutch-government/procedures-covered-by-message-box/), you can also request this document online via [Message Box](https://business.gov.nl/starting-your-business/communicating-with-the-dutch-government/message-box-the-fastest-way-to-communicate-with-the-dutch-government/).

You must make sure you isolate this waste in such a way it cannot contaminate the soil or the environment.

OZB consists of 2 types of taxes:\r\n\r\n*   owner's tax\r\n*   user's tax\r\n\r\nThe party that owns or uses the property on 1 January of each year has to pay the tax. Are you both the owner and the user of a business property, a shop or office building? Then you have to pay owner’s OZB and usually also user’s OZB. Owners of residential properties only have to pay owner’s tax.\r\n\r\n## Property tax rate\r\n\r\nThe amount of tax owed depends on the value of the property. The municipal authority appraises the property in order to determine its value under the Valuation of Immovable Property Act (*Wet Waardering Onroerende Zaken, WOZ*), which is known as the '[WOZ value](https://www.government.nl/topics/valuation-of-immovable-property)' (*WOZ-waarde*). The municipal authority determines the WOZ-percentage annually. This percentage of your commercial property's value determines how much OZB you will have to pay. You will receive the OZB assessment automatically. You can check the WOZ value through the Dutch-language [WOZ value counter](https://www.wozwaardeloket.nl/) (*WOZ-waardeloket*).\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with the OZB assessment, you have to [appeal the WOZ-value](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/waardering-onroerende-zaken-woz/vraag-en-antwoord/bezwaar-woz-beschikking) within 6 weeks with your municipal authority (in Dutch).",

In most municipalities you need a terrace permit (*terrasvergunning*). This applies to terraces placed on public property as well as on private property. You apply for a terrace permit to the municipal authorities.\r\n\r\n## Is a terrace permit mandatory?\r\n\r\nIt depends on your municipality if you need a terrace permit. In some municipalities you may add a terrace without a permit if you meet specific criteria, such as predetermined size limits or location-based conditions. Other municipalities allow you to change or extend your existing [licence under the Alcohol Act](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/serving-alcohol-under-licencing-and-catering-act/) or [All-in-one Permit for Physical Aspects](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/scope-permit-physical-aspects/). In these cases, you do not need a separate terrace permit. Consult your municipality for the requirements if you want to add a terrace.\r\n\r\n## Applying for a terrace permit\r\n\r\nYou apply for a permit to your municipality. You can apply digitally using [Message Box](https://business.gov.nl/starting-your-business/communicating-with-the-dutch-government/message-box-the-fastest-way-to-communicate-with-the-dutch-government/).

Consult your municipality for more information. However, some rules apply throughout the Netherlands:\r\n\r\n*   A terrace is only allowed outside an existing catering establishment.\r\n*   A terrace may not cause any damage to the road\r\n*   A terrace may not pose a danger to road users\r\n*   A terrace may not form an obstacle to road management and maintenance\r\n\r\n### Monitoring and enforcement\r\n\r\nYour municipality will monitor if you follow the rules. For example if you comply with [local noise regulations](https://www.infomil.nl/onderwerpen/integrale/activiteitenbesluit/activiteiten/sport-recreatie/terrassen-0/geluidsvoorschriften/) (in Dutch). Local authorities may impose sanctions if you violate the rules. They can for instance temporarily close your terrace or revoke your terrace permit.\r\n\r\n## Terrace season\r\n\r\nSome municipalities have a terrace season. In that case, you receive a permit for the duration of the season. The terrace permit states the period for which it has been issued. If your municipality does not have a terrace season, you can have a terrace throughout the entire year.\r\n\r\n## Cost of a terrace permit\r\n\r\nIn most municipalities you will have to pay [municipal administrative charges](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/administrative-charges/) (*leges*) for a terrace permit. The amount of those charges is specified in the municipal administrative charges by-law (*legesverordening*). If your terrace is located on land of the municipality, then you must pay a [municipal tax on encroachments on or above public land](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/municipal-tax-encroachments-public-land/) (*precariobelasting*).",

This is the so-called '[all-in-one permit for physical aspects](https://rwsenvironment.eu/subjects/general-provisions-0/all-one-permit/)' (Omgevingsvergunning).\r\n\r\nThis permit [can be used instead of applying for several individual permits](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/scope-permit-physical-aspects/). Under the [WABO Act](https://rwsenvironment.eu/subjects/general-provisions-0/) (Wet Algemene Bepalingen Omgevingswet) it is possible to apply for permits via the same procedure. Do the online [permit check](https://www.omgevingsloket.nl/Zakelijk/zakelijk/home/checken?init=true=true) (in Dutch) to assess the exact type of all-in-one permit you need for your specific activity.\r\n\r\n## How to apply for an all-in-one permit\r\n\r\nYou apply to your municipality. Or you apply at the '[Service counter all-in-one permit for physical aspects](https://www.omgevingsloket.nl/Zakelijk/zakelijk/home?init=true#)' (Omgevingsloket Online, OLO). You can apply digitally or in writing. You can also authorise somebody else to apply for you. Please note that the online application service OLO is in Dutch only.\r\n\r\nThere are different options to apply:\r\n\r\n### Digital application for companies listed in the Dutch Business Register (Handelsregister)\r\n\r\nYou apply digitally through your municipality's website. Or you apply directly through the [OLO website](https://www.omgevingsloket.nl/Zakelijk/zakelijk/home?init=true#) (in Dutch). You will have to identify yourself with [eHerkenning (eRecognition)](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/applying-for-a-permit-or-subsidy-with-eherkenning/) with assurance level 2 or higher. If you have applied for the permit online via OLO, you can have the handling of your application proceeded through [Message Box](https://business.gov.nl/starting-your-business/communicating-with-the-dutch-government/message-box-the-fastest-way-to-communicate-with-the-dutch-government/). For this you fill in your Message Box name with the application.\r\n\r\n### Digital application for non-resident foreign companies and non-resident foreign private persons\r\n\r\nNon-resident foreign companies and non-resident foreign private persons cannot use eHerkenning. So, the procedure is slightly different for them. If you belong to one of these categories, you must first apply for a special account at InfoMil. There are 2 options to apply for a special account:\r\n\r\n*   [Online application non-resident foreign company account (InfoMil, in Dutch)](https://www.infomil.nl/contactformulier/account-bedrijven/)\r\n*   [Online application for non-resident private person account (InfoMil, in Dutch)](https://www.infomil.nl/contactformulier/account-particulier/)\r\n\r\nGenerally, you will receive your username and password within 2 days. You can use these to apply for a permit for physical aspects at the [OLO website](https://www.omgevingsloket.nl/Zakelijk/zakelijk/home?init=true).\r\n\r\n### Written applications\r\n\r\nFor written applications there is 1 uniform form. This form is available at your municipality, which will send it to you at your request. You can also fill in the (Dutch-language) [paper application form](https://www.omgevingsloket.nl/Zakelijk/zakelijk/home/papierenformulier?init=true) online on the OLO website, then print and send it.\r\n\r\n## Consult municipality prior to applying\r\n\r\nWould you like to know in advance whether an application is promising or not? You can mention this during your online application. The municipal authority will then check this with you. Please note that this service is not available in every municipality.\r\n\r\n## Decision on your application\r\n\r\nUsually, the municipal authorities decide within 8 weeks whether you will be granted an all-in-one permit. More complex applications may take up to 6 months.\r\n\r\n## Objection and appeal\r\n\r\nHas you application been denied? You can object in writing to your municipality. You must state clearly why you disagree with the decision.\r\n\r\nIs your objection (partially) rejected by the municipal authorities? You can [appeal to the court](https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Onderwerpen/Omgevingsvergunning/Paginas/procedure.aspx) (in Dutch). You can do so up until 6 weeks after the municipality's decision.

You must register your organisation with the [National Childcare Register](https://www.landelijkregisterkinderopvang.nl/pp/#/) (Landelijk Register Kinderopvang, LRK, in Dutch). You must submit an application for this registration to your local municipality at least 10 weeks before opening your business.\r\n\r\n## What is the register for?\r\n\r\nThe [National Childcare Register LRK lists childcare facilities](https://www.landelijkregisterkinderopvang.nl/pp/#/) (in Dutch) that have been [checked and approved](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/municipal-health-service-inspection-childcare-facilities/) by the municipalities and municipal health services (GGD).

It contains information about the location of the childcare facility, the number of places available, inspection reports and any warnings or penalties it has received. Information about childcare facilities that have closed will remain in the register for a certain amount of time.\r\n\r\nEvery facility in the register will receive its own unique code (LRK-code). Parents need this code in order to apply for [childcare benefit](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/benefits/moving_to_the_netherlands/my_child_goes_to_a_childcare_centre/).\r\n\r\n## How to register?\r\n\r\nYou need to apply for permission to open your childcare facility with your local municipality 10 weeks before you intend to start. You should send the application form together with other necessary documents to the municipality where you want to start your facility. This includes:\r\n\r\n*   [the pedagogical policy plan](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/pedagogical-policy-plan/)\r\n*   [the safety and health risk inventory](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/childcare-health-and-safety-policy/) of the facility (for each location)\r\n*   [Certificate of Conduct](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/vog/) (VOG) with screening profile 84 (caring for minors) or 86 (working in the childcare sector)\r\n*   [your registration in the Business Register](/regulation/registering-foreign-business-netherlands)\r\n\r\nIf you start a childminding agency, you must not only register your agency, but also your [childminders](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/childminders/), substitute childminders, as well as their locations. Your staff also need a certificate of conduct. Separate forms are available for different types of childcare facilities (see below). New childminders and/or locations must always be registered by your agency.\r\n\r\n## Registration forms\r\n\r\nFor registration, please select the appropriate form below to suit your type of childcare organisation and apply at least 10 weeks prior to opening your childcare facility. **Please note:** All forms are in Dutch.\r\n\r\n*   \r\n\r\n### Childcare centre, out-of-school care centre and parent participation centre\r\n\r\n    *   [Application registration](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/kinderopvang/documenten/formulieren/2015/12/18/ko-aanvraag-exploitatie-kinderdagverblijf-of-buitenschoolse-opvang)\r\n    *   [Changing your registration](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/kinderopvang/documenten/formulieren/2015/12/18/wijziging-kinderdagverblijf-of-buitenschoolse-opvang)\r\n*   \r\n\r\n### Childminding agency\r\n\r\n    *   [Application registration](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/kinderopvang/documenten/formulieren/2015/12/18/aanvraag-exploitatie-gastouderbureau)\r\n    *   [Changing your registration](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/kinderopvang/documenten/formulieren/2015/12/18/wijziging-gastouderbureau)\r\n*   \r\n\r\n### Childminders\r\n\r\n    *   [Application registration](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/kinderopvang/documenten/formulieren/2015/12/18/aanvraag-exploitatie-gastouderopvang)\r\n    *   [Changing your registration](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/kinderopvang/documenten/formulieren/2015/12/18/wijziging-gastouderopvang)\r\n\r\n## After your application\r\n\r\nA [Municipal Health Authority (GGD) inspector](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/municipal-health-service-inspection-childcare-facilities/) (in Dutch) will assess whether your organisation meets all the requirements. Strict rules apply to childcare facilities. You must notify the municipal authority immediately of any changes of information and details regarding your registration.\r\n\r\n## Multiple branches, change of location or franchising\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple branches, you must register each branch in the LRK. If you change your location, you submit a new registration for this new location. In the event of a franchise, the franchisee must register as the owner. The franchisor is not included in the LRK.\r\n\r\nDo you run a childminding agency with several facilities? You must register them all. You submit a new application for each (new) childcare facility.\r\n\r\n## Foreign childcare register\r\n\r\nThe [foreign childcare register](https://duo.nl/particulier/register-buitenlandse-kinderopvang.jsp) (in Dutch) lists foreign organisations that meet the Dutch rules around childcare. Do you run a childcare facility in an EU Member State, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland? And do you care for Dutch children? The parents may be [entitled to childcare benefit](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/individuals/benefits/moving_to_the_netherlands/my_child_goes_to_a_childcare_centre/my_child_goes_to_a_childcare_centre) from the Netherlands. This is only the case if your organisation meets the official standards and is registered in the foreign childcare register.\r\n\r\n## Online application procedure via Message Box\r\n\r\nYou can submit the application to register your childcare organisation also online via [Message Box](https://business.gov.nl/starting-your-business/communicating-with-the-dutch-government/message-box-the-fastest-way-to-communicate-with-the-dutch-government/).
